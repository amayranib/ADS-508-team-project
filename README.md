## Abstract

Our team will analyze the impact of sick leave policies, vaccination rates, and flexible work arrangements on workplace health outcomes and productivity. Using predictive modeling, we aim to identify optimal policy configurations that balance employee well-being with business performance.

## Problem Statement

Our team represents the data science department at Lunara Tech, a consulting firm specializing in workplace health policy optimization. Our company wants to redesign their health policies to improve productivity and retention while controlling costs. Using public datasets from the CDC, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and census data, we'll develop predictive models to determine the optimal combination of sick leave flexibility, vaccination incentives, and wellness programs that maximize ROI. Our goal is to provide actionable recommendations on policy design and implementation that balances employee wellbeing with business outcomes.

### Goals

1. Work policy optimization: develop recommendations for sick leave, wellness programs, and work schedule accommodations from statistical analysis of public datasets. This would improve employee well-being while aligning with business goals.
2. Productivity Enhancement: provide metrics that show how workplace health policies impact missed work days, team engagement, and overall workforce efficiency to maximize productivity.
3. Cost Efficiency & ROI Maximization: develop a predictive model for policy ROI. The machine learning model will predict the financial return on investment for different combinations of sick leave, vaccination programs, and wellness initiatives based on company characteristics.

### Non-Goals

1. Individual Employee Health Tracking: Data collection will not involve personally identifiable health data of employees.
2. Legal Compliance Advisory: Legal guidance on labor laws, OSHA or Cal/OSHA requirements, or healthcare regulation will not be provided.
3. Medical or Clinical Recommendations: Medical treatments, vaccination protocols, or individual health interventions will not be prescribed or evaluated.
